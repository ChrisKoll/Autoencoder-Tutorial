# Autoencoder Tutorial

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that provide comprehensive tutorials on implementing an Autoencoder and a Variational Autoencoder using the MNIST dataset.

**Notebooks Included:**
1. Autoencoder (AE) Tutorial: This notebook guides you through the basics of building and training an Autoencoder, demonstrating how to use it for data compression and reconstruction with the MNIST dataset
2. Variational Autoencoder (VAE) Tutorial: This notebook covers the implementation of a Variational Autoencoder, based on the Autoencoder example.

These tutorials were implemented to better understand the concepts and applications of Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders, providing hands-on experience with these powerful neural network architectures.
